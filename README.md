Start of the backend:
    1) go to the backend folder.
    2) execute the command `docker-compose up --build` with docker running on the PC.
    3) Next, the console will display a log of all running services.



Launching frontend:
    1) Install the latest version of the xcode program
    2) Open the file `incubator.xcodeproj` using xcode
    3) Launch the application in the emulator.


Attention!!!
    Both backend and frontend must be run on the same computer, since localhost is used for network communication.
